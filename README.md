## File Helper
I programmed a file helper terminal bash script to generate a test file(s) and rename a series of the file(s) for my development process, therefore I could quickly generate dummy test data files, or rename files to let my projects be more organized. I also add my profile hyperlinks in the bash script, so that you can click the links from the terminal while executing the script to visit my pages if you are interested in me.
